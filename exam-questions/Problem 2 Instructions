Suppose you are given two strings, s1 and s2. You would like to "lace" these strings together, by successively alternating elements of each string (starting with the first character of s1). If one string is longer than the other, then the remaining elements of the longer string should simply be added at the end of the new string. For example, if we lace 'abcd' and 'efghi', we would get the new string: 'aebfcgdhi'.

Write an iterative procedure, called laceStrings(s1, s2) that does this.
